I created a PHP program that demonstrates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The program should include a form that allows users to submit a comments

The Comment should be displayed on a webpages without proper sanitization, allowing potential script injection 


This is the give link to check Cross-Site Script
